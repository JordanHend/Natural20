Natural20 

![Alt text](/Images/ex1.png?raw=true "Example")

This is an idea i had while playing dnd with friends.

We use Roll20 for online map viewing of the campaign, and the DM complains A LOT over the functionality, and as a spectator it can get a bit weird as well. 

I just wanted to create a streamlined version of it.
